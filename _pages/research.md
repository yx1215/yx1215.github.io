Parallelization of Monopoly Game Simulations
======
New York University Shanghai, 02/2020~05/2020
Supervised by [Prof. Olivier Marine](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/olivier-marin)
* Created a monopoly game for simulation and enabled simple AI players using Python, 
  which allows the user to change basic variables such as income and tax in each round. 
  The implemented monopoly game contains most functions in the original monopoly game, 
  such as moving, picking cards, buying/selling properties and trading.
* Designed a user-friendly interface using Electron to allow non-CS users to 
  easily run simulations on HPC in NYUSH to improve performance.
* Assessed the influence of basic variables on game duration analyzed the reason.

Electronic Health Record System
======
New York University Shanghai, 09/2019~12/2019
Supervised by [Prof. Lihua Xu](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/lihua-xu)
* Aimed to build a web-based application for doctor and patients to store medical appointment records. 
* Used Flask framework in Python to build the database and develop the app backend
* Used Bootstrap framework along with JavaScript to develop the app front end.
* With the application, patients and doctors will be able to manage their appointments and have necessary conversations via a built-in chat system.

Project on Course Assignment Mechanism
======
New York University, 05/2019~08/2019
Supervised by [Prof. Richard Cole](https://cs.nyu.edu/cole/)
* Aimed to improve a more fair and efficient algorithm for Law Schoolâ€™s course selection system of New York University  
* Read five papers to understand the advantages and disadvantages of existing resource allocation algorithms 
* Designed the reasonable algorithms for Law School of New York University  
* According to the new algorithm designed to establish the applicable data structure to reduce time complexity 

Style Recognition for Chinese Calligraphy
======
New York University Shanghai, 05/2018~08/2018
* Aimed to obtain a model that could automatically recognize calligraphic fonts based on calligraphic pictures 
* Downloaded 50,000 pictures of different calligraphic fonts by using crawler scripts and did digital processing 
* Used CNN framework in pytorch to train the data set to get the model 

Chat System
======
New York University Shanghai, 04/2018~05/2018
Supervised by [Prof. Zheng Zhang](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/zheng-zhang)
* Aimed to writing an entertainment platform for multi-person online chat simulation 
* Completed the chat system based on the simple framework provided to achieve multi-person simultaneous online and group chat  
* Added the functions of five chess to the chat system, and also wrote a simple AI to support both man-machine and man-to-man battle
