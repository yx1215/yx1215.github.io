I am Yixiang Xiao, a graduate from New York University Shanghai. I double major in 
Computer Science and Data Science. The main programming language that I use is Python,
but I am also familiar with C and Javascript. I am interested in software development, algorithm design and 
machine learning applications. I have done some projects related to these fields. For backend software
design, I designed a web-base electronic health record system and a chat system. For algorithm design, I've done a research 
with Prof. Richard Cole to develop an advanced algorithm for course allocation that takes both time complexity and
fairness into account. For machine learning application, I build a Convolutional Neural Network that recognizes the calligraphic style of 
different works, and a model that helps allocating taxi deployments to minimize road congestion. You can see more about these projects here.
